# The Nest — Claude Code Session Rules
> Read SETUP.md next. It is the definitive source of truth: current build state, all Blobs keys, API routes, and full history of what's been built.

---

## Mandatory Rules — Never Break These

1. **Read SETUP.md first**, every session, before touching any file.
2. **Update SETUP.md before committing** any changes. No exceptions.
3. **Work in `output/`** — that's the deployable site root.
4. **Deploy:** `git push origin main` → Netlify auto-deploys. No manual steps.
5. **DataForSEO: Standard mode ONLY** — `task_post` + `task_get` polling. NEVER use live/advanced endpoints. Batch max 100 keywords per POST.
6. **Jordan URL is `/pickl-jordan/`** — NEVER change this. Already indexed by Google.
7. **Background functions** must be called at `/.netlify/functions/<name>` directly — redirects in netlify.toml do NOT work for them.
8. **Bootstrap admins** (always Admin regardless of Blobs): `shazin@yolkbrands.com`, `steve@yolkbrands.com`
9. **Claude model:** `claude-sonnet-4-6` (set in `_lib/store.js` callClaude function)
10. **Syntax check** all JS before committing: `node --check` on every function file + extract and check index.html JS.
